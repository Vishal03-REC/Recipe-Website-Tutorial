Part 5 - Common Application Features/Adding Features to the Recipe Website 
============================================================================

Flask is a very simple micro-framework and as a result it is easy to get started quickly without having to learn
lots of additional concepts. So far we have been able to manage with the functionality that Flask provides
such as:

- routing (or some other equivalent way of resolving URLs)
- templating engines (simple template, jinja2 and mako)
- request and response data management
- login 
- database connections

When we come upon something that Flask cannot do we then import modules.
For example if you need to provide third part authentication for facebook, twitter and google, Flask doesn't have that
functionality built in.
For these additional features we will rely on third-party modules.

We will use the following modules to implement:
