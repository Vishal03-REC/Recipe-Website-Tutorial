Part 5 - Common Application Features/Adding Features to the Recipe Website 
============================================================================

Flask is a very simple micro-framework and as a result it is easy to get started quickly without having to learn
lots of additional concepts. So far we have been able to manage with the functionality that Flask provides
such as:

- routing (or some other equivalent way of resolving URLs)
- templating engines (simple template, jinja2 and mako)
- request and response data management
- login 
- database connections

When we come upon something that Flask cannot do we then import modules.
For example if you need to provide third part authentication for facebook, twitter and google, Flask doesn't have that
functionality built in.
For these additional features we will rely on third-party modules.

We will use the following modules to implement:

Reviewing the Recipe Page
----------------------------

Let's review the recipe page, here is the mockup.

.. image:: ../images/recipe-page.png

Our recipe will have the following properties:

#. Picture
#. Ingredients
#. Directions
#. Cooking Time
#. Preparation Time

Other properties might include:

#. Recipe Title
#. Tags


Working with Databases
----------------------------------------

Our recipes will have the following features:

We'll create some supporting files: `database.py` and `models.py`

Install flask-sqlalchemy::

    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install flask-sqlalchemy

::

	from sqlalchemy import create_engine
	from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker
	from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

	engine = create_engine('sqlite:////tmp/test.db', convert_unicode=True)
	db_session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(autocommit=False,
						 autoflush=False,
						 bind=engine))
	Base = declarative_base()
	Base.query = db_session.query_property()

	def init_db():
	    # import all modules here that might define models so that
	    # they will be registered properly on the metadata.  Otherwise
	    # you will have to import them first before calling init_db()
	    import yourapplication.models
	    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
