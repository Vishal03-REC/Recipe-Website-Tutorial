Part 7 - Deploying on Google App Engine
===========================================

Google App Engine (GAE) is sometimes called a 
platform as a service (PAAS) because it provides specific utilities for things like data persistence, authentication and user management. 

.. note:: If you don't mind following "the App Engine way" the benefit is a free platform for deploying webscale applications on infrastructure managed by Google. App Engine has a threshold at which point you will need to pay about USD $9 per month, this fee increases as you consume more resources.
While App Engine is great for some application there has been `discussion about App Engine charges`_ which suggest some applications are not economical on GAE.

Setting up the Flask GAE Scaffold 
--------------------------------------------

For working with App Engine we will use 
a directory structure inspired by this `github repository with a flask template for GAE`_. 
This will be our standard way of arranging directories for applications that we will deploy to GAE.
The scaffold also includes the App Engine Software Development Kit (SDK).

We will refer to this as the **GAE scaffold**. Download it from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1004432/flask_gae.zip

The unzipped directory structure looks something like this::

	flask_gae
	├── app_template
	│   ├── application
	│   ├── packages
	│   └── tests
	├── docs
	├── google_appengine
	│   ├── demos
	│   ├── google
	│   ├── lib
	│   ├── new_project_template
	│   └── tools
	└── licenses
	
It bundles the app engine deployment tools and provides two convenience scripts (run.sh and deploy.sh in the app_template)

What you will need:

- An account with App Engine (visit http://appengine.google.com to sign up)
- The Flask GAE Scaffold http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1004432/flask_gae.zip
- Python 2.5 
    Google App Engine is designed to work with Python 2.5 newer versions of Python are known to have issues. Ensure that you have this installed, on Windows you may consider using `Portable Python 2.5 <http://www.portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython1.1Py2.5.4>`_.
- bootstrapflask.py http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1004432/bootstrapflask.py

Sign up with App Engine
------------------------

Visit http://appengine.google.com and sign up by creating a new application.

.. image:: ../images/appenginestart.png

For each application that you create on App Engine there is an ``Administration`` section where you can manage 
``Application Settings``. The most import setting for us is the ``Application Identifier``, we will need to know this name.

Use Python 2.5 to bootstrap flask
------------------------------------

To install flask  and virtualenv place ``bootstrapflask.py`` in the target folder of your choice and run, be sure
to use Python 2.5::

   python2.5 bootstrapflask.py

This creates a virtual environment called ``venv``.
When you need to use this environment it can be activated using the following commands::

   source venv/bin/activate

.. warning:: Are you sure you used Python 2.5? There will be issues if you didn't!

Running your application locally
-------------------------------------

Download the Flask GAE Scaffold to the target folder (the same one target folder used above) and unzip it.

The instructions below are for Unix, we assume that `flask_gae` and `venv` are in the same target folder.
Start in your target folder (the folder containing both venv and flask_gae).

#. Activate the Python 2.5 virtual environment

       venv/bin/activate

#. Copy `app_template` to `MyApp`::

       cp -r flask_gae/app_template flask_gae/MyApp

#. Test that it is working by running the run.sh script::

       cd flask_gae/MyApp
       sh run.sh 

Deploying your application to GAE
-------------------------------------

#. Edit the `app.yaml` file (ensure that the value for ``application`` matches your ``Application Identifier``.

#. Deploy your application to Google App Engine 

        sh deploy.sh

.. note:: remember to `export http_proxy=scalpel:8080` or whatever your appropriate proxy settings are if you need to.

.. note:: For more on proxy issues check out :ref:`dealing_with_proxies`

app.yaml and App Engine Versions
----------------------------------

Your applications can be given new version numbers by configuring them in the ``app.yaml`` file.

After deploying a new version you will need to set it to be the default version, in order to see the changes.

Taking advantage of the GAE users api and Datastore api
---------------------------------------------------------

Since we will be deploying to GAE, we might as well take advantage of features that GAE provides, especially those
features that Flask does not provide, specifically:

- User account management (Authentication, Sessions, Login)
- Database backend

We will use App Engine's ``Datastore`` and ``Users`` API, read about both in `getting started with App Engine`_.

Adding Third Party Auth 
--------------------------

XXX Fixme discuss engineauth and the need for app engine python 2. 7 version

http://engineauth.readthedocs.org


Discussion
-----------

- What does PAAS mean? How is a PAAS different from normal webhosting? 

- One feature of App Engine is application version management. What would you use this for?
