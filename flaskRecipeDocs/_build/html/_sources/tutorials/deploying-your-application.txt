Part 3 - Deploying your Application
===========================================

Deployment may seem overly involved at first, just remember that the items noted as setup steps are almost never repeated. Those items noted as initial steps are done once for a project.

Sign up with Fluxflex and create a new project [setup step]
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Register an account with http://fluxflex.com,
   log in and "create a new project".

2. You can check out your new project by name using git. For example if your project is called ``yourprojectname``::

   git clone ssh://git@git.fluxflex.com:443/yourprojectname

 To confirm the proper procedure, go to "Setup" > "Git" and copy the code for downloading your project.

Registering a Public SSH Key [setup step]
---------------------------------------------------
.. note:: **SSH Public Key based Authentication in a nutshell**  
          SSH Key based Authentication is an alternative to password based authentication. 
          The methodology depends on the ssh protocol and public keys. A provider, such as Fluxflex.com, stores a list of 
          ``Authorized Public Keys`` provided by an authorized user. When a user attempts to connect to the server a ``Challenge`` is sent by 
          the server using an appropriate ``Public Key``. Only a machine configured with the correct ``Private Key`` can send a suitable response.
          If a suitable ``Key Response`` is made authorization is allowed. Authorization is denied if there is no suitable response.

This step is done once per machine.
If you haven't done it before, or if you want to create a new key, use ``ssh-keygen`` to generate a public key.
::

    ssh-keygen

Accept all the defaults.

.. note:: If you are on Windows, follow the information here: http://doc.fluxflex.com/pubkey

To view and copy your public key use the ``cat`` command to dump the contents of the public key to the terminal::

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

.. image:: ../images/cat-ssh-rsapub.png

Then paste the resulting output to your fluxflex key list by going to "Plan & Settings" > "Public Keys" > "SSH Public Keys List" and click "Save".

Preparing the directory for publishing to fluxflex [initial step]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The flaskflex.py tool is a quick way to prepare a brand new fluxflex project for deployment as a flask application to fluxflex.

1. Use git to download yourproject by name (eg. if it is called `yourprojectname` it may look like this
::

   git clone ssh://git@git.fluxflex.com:443/yourprojectname

The result will be a directory structure something like this::

.. image:: ../images/flux-checkout-after.png

2. You will need to activate the virtual environment that you've been using for your application.

.. note::
   flaskflex.py generates a req.txt file which is based on your virtual environment
   so it is important that you activate your virtual environment!
       .. image:: ../images/activate.gif

3. Download flaskflex.py to your fluxflex project directory and run flaskflex.py.
   flaskflex.py prepares your project for deployment to fluxflex::
   
     cd yourprojectname
     wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1004432/flaskflex.py
     python flaskflex.py 

.. note:: flaskflex.py adds the directory structure and 
    files needed to deploy your application to fluxflex. 
    You should now see the following files added to your project::

	.flx
	public_html
	    ├── .htaccess
	    └── dispatch.fcgi
        req.txt


Add your application to the fluxflex project [initial step]
----------------------------------------------------------------
``flaskflex.py`` follows the following conventions:

1. It expects your application to exist in a folder called ``application`` and to be called ``app.py`` (look at the public_html/dispatch.fcgi file for this information).

2. It expects all the requirements for your application to be listed in req.txt

The steps for deployment are as follows:

1. Copy your flask application to the fluxflex project folder, such that your application's folder will be called `application`. 
2. If necessary rename the contained application to `app.py`.

If your fluxflex project folder is called `yourprojectname` and your flask application is called `yourflaskapplication`, you might so something like this::

   cp -r yourflaskapplication yourprojectname/application

If the .py file in `yourflaskapplication` was named `myapp.py`, then you might do something like::

  cd yourprojectname/application
  mv myapp.py app.py

Use git to update and publish your application [initial step]
------------------------------------------------------------------
::

   git add .
   git commit -a -m 'initial deployment'
   git push

Visit your application to see it working
------------------------------------------
Allow 1 to 2 minutes for the application to be available online. You should be able to visit your new application at `yourapplicationname`.fluxflex.com.

The Update and Deploy cycle
------------------------------
New deployments are basically done after changes have been committed and a `git push` is 
initiated.

Discussion
-----------

- Fluxflex doesn't use passwords for autWhat is the benefit have a standard directory structure?

- In what way do conventions make source code more maintainable?

- Any thoughts on what happens when you use virtualenv and the `source bin/activate` command? 

- What do you think happens when you set the `http_proxy` environment variable.?
