Recipe Website Tutorial
=================================================

This tutorial is based on the `Pyramid` web application
development framework.  Pyramid is an open source framework written 
in Python and is part of the `Pylons Project
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/>`_.  

Here is one of the simplest :app:`Pyramid` applications you can make:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/helloworld.py

When saved to ``helloworld.py``, the above application can be run via:

.. code-block:: text

   $ easy_install pyramid
   $ python helloworld.py

When you visit ``http://localhost:8080/hello/world`` in a browser, you will
see the text ``Hello, world!``.

See :ref:`planning_mockups_chapter` for a full explanation of how this application
works. Read the :ref:`html_narrative_documentation` to understand how
:app:`Pyramid` is designed to scale from simple applications like this to
very large web applications.
