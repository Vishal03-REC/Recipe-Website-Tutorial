Web Tutorials
=================================================

Overview
------------------------

I'm not sure of the scope of this yet, but I plan to keep web tutorials here.
Things that I find useful and relevant but are not in any other course yet will go here.

Tutorials
------------------------

Each tutorial includes discussion questions. It should be possible to work through the tutorial within 30 - 35 minutes and then spend 15 to 20 minutes in discussion, guided by the discussion questions.

Index and Glossary
------------------------

* :ref:`glossary`
* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`search`


.. add glossary, foreword, and latexindex in a hidden toc to avoid warnings
