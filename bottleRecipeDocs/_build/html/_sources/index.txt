Recipe Website Tutorial
=================================================

This tutorial is based on the `Bottle` web application
development microframework. 
Learn more about Bottle at `The Bottle Website
<http://bottlepy.org/>`_.  

According to the Bottle documentation the following is the simplest Bottle application that you can make:

.. literalinclude:: hello.py

When saved to ``helloworld.py``, the above application can be run via:

.. code-block:: text

   $ pip install bottle
   $ python helloworld.py

When you visit ``http://localhost:8080/hello/world`` in a browser, you will
see the text ``Hello world!``.

This is a simple single file application.
As our tasks become more complex there comes a point
when we will need supporting templates, CSS, JS and image files.
This tutorial will focus on building a "Recipe Website" using the Bottle 
microframework.


Tutorials
=======================

Each tutorial includes discussion questions. It should be possible to work through the tutorial within 30 - 35 minutes and then spend 15 to 20 minutes in discussion, guided by the discussion questions.
