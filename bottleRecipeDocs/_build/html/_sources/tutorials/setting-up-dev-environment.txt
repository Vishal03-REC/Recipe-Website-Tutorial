Setting up your development environment
===========================================

In this tutorial we gather our tools. We assume that you already have a trusted text editor.
So we will focus on the tools needed to build out the new application.
It is recommended that you use a UNIX/Linux environment, though everything should also work on Windows.

Installing the Bottle web framework
-----------------------------------------

You will need the following:

- A python interpreter

- The ability to compile source code

- and the python virtualenv package

If you are on a network with a proxy then pay careful attention to the next section.

Dealing with on campus proxies
-------------------------------

.. note: All the examples below are specific to the UWI Mona network, but should be applicable to other 
locations that use a proxy on their network.

**Known UWI proxies** 
	scalpel, proxy-cluster, proxy1, proxy3, sword
        while we use `scalpel` in our examples
        any of the ones listed should work

- All proxies are configured to run on port 8080. 

After launching the terminal (or commandline) it is important to set the http_proxy
environmental variable, BEFORE running any other command

**On Unix** 

::

   export http_proxy=proxy3:8080

**On Windows** 

the same can be acheived by using `set` instead of `export`::


   set http_proxy=proxy3:8080

.. note:: For persons using `sudo` on Unix. Be careful if you use `sudo` on Unix, `sudo` may not inherit the http_proxy environment variable if you set it without `sudo`.

Using Virtualenv
------------------

Virtualenv allows you to create complete python environment without the need for administrative access.

To install Bottle, create a virtualenv::

   mkdir venv
   cd venv
   virtualenv --no-site-packages .

When ever you need to use this environment use the command::

   cd venv
   source bin/activate

On Windows the following is enough

   cd venv
   Scripts/activate

.. note::   .. image:: ../images/activate.gif
   Remember to activate your virtual environment!
   If you neglect this, `pip` will behave in unpredictable ways,
   you will get permission errors
   and other strange behaviour.

Then install bottle using the pip command::

    pip install bottle

.. note:: `pip` stands for "Pip Installs Packages", it is a package installer designed to install python packages (similar to apt-get on Debian or Ubuntu).
        It has been affectionately referred to as `the new hotness`_.

Creating the scaffolds for our project
-----------------------------------------

Establishing conventions help to make source code more maintainable, Bottle
does not provide a standard approach to managing our code so we will make
some decisions ourselves.

.. note:: the term "scaffold" comes form the construction industry and roughly means "structure".


We will use the following directory structure::
    
	RecipeWebsite/
	└── recipewebsite
	    ├── static
	    └── templates

This structure will be very useful if we later on decided to make our site into a full python packages.

Enter the `RecipeWebsite/recipewebsite` folder

.. note::   .. image:: ../images/activate.gif
   Remember to activate your virtual environment!

Create a file called `app.py`
Your directory will now look like this
::

	RecipeWebsite/
	└── recipewebsite
	    ├── app.py
	    ├── static
	    └── templates

To view the new application in your browser run the following command::

    python app.py

.. literalblock:: ../bottleRecipeWebsite/app.py


.. warning:: sometimes this will will fail because another service on your machine may already be running on the port  (you can change the port in the `app.py` file or stop the conflicting service).


Visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser will display the following text in your browser::

Requirements and setup.py
--------------------------

If you need new functionality you can declare a requirement in your 
new package. This will prove very useful in the future.

Take a look at `setup.py` 
Note the `requires` lines::

	requires = [
	    'pyramid',
	    'pyramid_zodbconn',
	    'pyramid_tm',
	    'pyramid_debugtoolbar',
	    'ZODB3',
	    'waitress',
	    ]

Each of these refers to a package that our `RecipeWebsite` application depends on.
When the `python setup.py develop` command is invoked the required dependencies are installed. 

Where the code lives
------------------------

Throughout this project, most of your code and customizations will be done 
in the `recipewebsite` subdirectory.
Note that the subdirectory is all lowercase, even though the package 
directory is `RecipeWebsite`.

Discussion
-----------

- What is the benefit of using the `pcreate` command to create a directory structure?

- We used pip to install packages, in python circles packages are often called `eggs`, can you guess why?

- In what way do conventions make source code more maintainable?

- Any thoughts on what happens when you use virtualenv and the `source bin/activate` command? 

- What do you think happens when you set the `http_proxy` environment variable.?

- What might cause an error like this: 
       `socket.error: [Errno 48] Address already in use`
